# Burrowes

## Description
A portfolio website for an author promoting his newest book, created with React JS. An original design built from a model that I created, featuring a background image utilizing a photograph of our beautiful shared homeland, Guyana. Utilizing integratable components, the application showcases content via easily navigable routes hosting accompanying views. React Bootstrap lends to a responsive design that serves content beautifully on any sized viewport.
